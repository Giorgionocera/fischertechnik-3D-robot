\section{Goal of the project}
The goals of this project are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item to manage to implement an high level control system of a robotic arm using MATLAB, TIA Portal and a Siemens SIMATIC S7-1200 PLC;
    \item to create a 3D model of the robot, to simulate its behaviour and to compute the direct and inverse kinematic;
    \item to validate the model performing a simple task in the real world: pick up an object, move it to another position and release it.
\end{itemize}
